# Wedding Greeting page
A simple webpage that records no more than 30 seconds of a webcam feed and stores it local to the server.
CSS and JS are embedded into html.

A PoC has been made for the greeting page.
test URL: https://diaz.world/greeting.html

### Todo:
- password protect the page
- assign a recording name per token (i.e. generated by email). That way each email gets one recording.
- [somewhat insecure] A way to auto-retrieve a recording upon providing the unique email address so return users can see their last recording.
- Confirmation prompt for when a recording exists and is going to be overwritten
- Include a button to stop recording
- Add a visualizer for the time left in the recording.
- email alert when a recording is made
- mobile browser support
- make the actual page background more decorated. Nothing too fancy, but it should be more than a black box in a whitespace.

### Wishful thinking:
- Apply decorative frame to recording
